This lab will provide you with a guide to utilizing NSO to create a simple service deployment in your network.

In this lab we will only setup the PE routers for a simple L3VPN use case.  Typically, you would also need the associate CE routers to complete the service.  However, we will demostrate NSO's capabilities to create, update and remove the service.  

## Setup

A vagrant script will bring up a two IOS-XR instances that will be networked together through gig0/0/0/2 (IP:10.1.1.1 and 10.1.1.2).  The vagrant script will also spin up an ubuntu instance which will be used for a custom web portal.
